### **Best Practices in Inheritance**

---

### **1. Favor Composition Over Inheritance**

While inheritance is powerful, it is not always the best solution. Use inheritance only when there is a clear "is-a" relationship. In cases where a "has-a" relationship exists, composition is often more appropriate. For example:

- **Inheritance**:
    ```csharp
    public class Vehicle
    {
        public void Start() => Console.WriteLine("Vehicle started");
    }

    public class Car : Vehicle
    {
    }
    ```

- **Composition**:
    ```csharp
    public class Engine
    {
        public void Start() => Console.WriteLine("Engine started");
    }

    public class Car
    {
        private Engine engine = new Engine();

        public void StartCar() => engine.Start();
    }
    ```

---

### **2. Keep Inheritance Hierarchies Shallow**

Deep inheritance hierarchies can lead to complex and difficult-to-maintain code. Aim to keep hierarchies shallow by:

- Limiting the number of levels in the hierarchy.
- Breaking down large classes into smaller, more focused ones.

---

### **3. Use Abstract Classes for Base Functionality**

Abstract classes are ideal for defining common functionality while requiring derived classes to implement specific behaviors.

- Example:
    ```csharp
    public abstract class Animal
    {
        public void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("Eating...");
        public abstract void Speak();
    }

    public class Dog : Animal
    {
        public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }

    public class Cat : Animal
    {
        public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Cat meows");
    }
    ```

---

### **4. Use Interfaces for Contracts**

When defining a behavior that multiple unrelated classes must implement, use interfaces instead of inheritance.

- Example:
    ```csharp
    public interface IDrawable
    {
        void Draw();
    }

    public class Circle : IDrawable
    {
        public void Draw() => Console.WriteLine("Drawing Circle");
    }

    public class Rectangle : IDrawable
    {
        public void Draw() => Console.WriteLine("Drawing Rectangle");
    }
    ```

---

### **5. Adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program. For example:

- **Good Practice**:
    ```csharp
    public class Bird
    {
        public virtual void Fly() => Console.WriteLine("Flying...");
    }

    public class Sparrow : Bird
    {
    }

    Bird myBird = new Sparrow();
    myBird.Fly(); // Works correctly
    ```

- **Bad Practice**:
    If a derived class overrides functionality in a way that violates the expectations of the base class, it can break the LSP.

---

### **6. Use `sealed` When Necessary**

Mark classes or methods as `sealed` when you do not want them to be further inherited or overridden.

- Example:
    ```csharp
    public class BaseClass
    {
        public virtual void DoWork() => Console.WriteLine("Base work");
    }

    public class DerivedClass : BaseClass
    {
        public sealed override void DoWork() => Console.WriteLine("Derived work");
    }
    ```

---

### **7. Test for Side Effects in Overridden Methods**

Ensure that overriding methods do not introduce unintended side effects. Always test overridden methods thoroughly.

---

### **8. Follow Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

Ensure that each class has a single responsibility. Avoid overloading base classes with too much functionality.

- Example:
    ```csharp
    public class ReportPrinter
    {
        public void PrintReport() => Console.WriteLine("Printing report...");
    }

    public class ReportGenerator
    {
        public void GenerateReport() => Console.WriteLine("Generating report...");
    }
    ```

---

### **Summary**

- Use inheritance judiciously and prefer composition when appropriate.
- Keep hierarchies shallow and adhere to SOLID principles.
- Use abstract classes and interfaces based on the requirements.
- Always test derived classes for correctness and side effects.
