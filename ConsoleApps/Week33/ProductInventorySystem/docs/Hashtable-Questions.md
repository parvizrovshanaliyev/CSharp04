## üíª Practical Exercises

### Basic Operations
1. Create a Hashtable to store student grades where:
   - Key: Student ID (string)
   - Value: Grade (int)
   ```csharp
   // Example solution
   Hashtable grades = new Hashtable();
   grades.Add("S001", 85);
   grades.Add("S002", 92);
   ```

2. Implement a method to find the average grade:
   ```csharp
   public double CalculateAverageGrade(Hashtable grades)
   {
       // Your implementation
   }
   ```

3. Create a method to find the highest grade:
   ```csharp
   public int FindHighestGrade(Hashtable grades)
   {
       // Your implementation
   }
   ```

### Type Handling
1. How do you handle different data types in a Hashtable?
2. What are the implications of storing different types in a Hashtable?
3. How do you safely cast values retrieved from a Hashtable?

### Common Patterns
1. Implement a method to merge two Hashtables:
   ```csharp
   public Hashtable MergeHashtables(Hashtable first, Hashtable second)
   {
       // Your implementation
   }
   ```

2. Create a method to find duplicate values:
   ```csharp
   public List<object> FindDuplicateValues(Hashtable table)
   {
       // Your implementation
   }
   ```

   {
       // Your implementation
   }
   ```

### Unit Testing
