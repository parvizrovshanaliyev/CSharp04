# 📘 Dispose Pattern & Unmanaged Code in .NET – A Beginner-Friendly Guide

## 🧠 Overview
This guide explains how unmanaged resources are handled in .NET, what the `IDisposable` interface is, how the Dispose pattern works, and how to write memory-safe code. It is written for beginners but includes technical depth to ensure strong foundational understanding.

## 🔍 What Are Unmanaged Resources?

### ✅ Definition:
Unmanaged resources are system-level resources not managed by the .NET runtime (CLR). They exist outside the control of the garbage collector.

### 🧩 Examples:
- File handles (e.g., FileStream)
- Network sockets
- Database connections
- Windows handles (HWND)
- Unmanaged memory allocated via `Marshal.AllocHGlobal()`

### ❗ Why Manual Cleanup is Needed:
The .NET garbage collector (GC) cannot track unmanaged resources. If they are not explicitly released, this can lead to:
- Memory leaks
- File locks
- Socket exhaustion

## ⚖️ Managed vs Unmanaged Resources

| Feature                | Managed Resources                   | Unmanaged Resources                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| GC Handles Them        | ✅ Yes                              | ❌ No                                     |
| Examples               | Strings, Lists, custom C# classes    | File handles, COM objects, native memory |
| Requires Manual Dispose| ❌ Not required                     | ✅ Yes                                    |
| Lifetime Control       | CLR                                 | Developer responsibility                 |

The GC automatically tracks and disposes managed objects, but **unmanaged resources require explicit cleanup** via `Dispose()`.

## 🧰 What is the `IDisposable` Interface?

`IDisposable` is a built-in interface in .NET that contains a single method:
```csharp
void Dispose();
```

### 🎯 Purpose:
It gives a standard mechanism to free unmanaged resources.

### 💡 Common Use Cases:
- `FileStream`
- `SqlConnection`
- `StreamWriter`
- `HttpClient`

These classes use unmanaged resources internally and therefore implement `IDisposable`.

## 🛠️ The Dispose Pattern in Practice

### 🔹 Basic Implementation:
```csharp
public class MyResource : IDisposable
{
    private bool _disposed = false;

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this); // Prevent finalizer call
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!_disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // free managed resources here
            }
            // free unmanaged resources here
            _disposed = true;
        }
    }
}
```

### 🔹 Advanced: Adding Finalizer
```csharp
~MyResource()
{
    Dispose(false); // Finalizer only calls unmanaged cleanup
}
```

### 🧱 SafeHandle Alternative:
For most scenarios, prefer inheriting from `SafeHandle` instead of directly working with raw pointers.
```csharp
public sealed class MySafeHandle : SafeHandle
{
    public override bool IsInvalid => handle == IntPtr.Zero;
    public override bool ReleaseHandle() { /* free native handle */ return true; }
}
```

---

## ✨ When and Why to Use `using` Statements

### 🔄 Simplifies Dispose Calls:
```csharp
using (FileStream fs = new FileStream("file.txt", FileMode.Open))
{
    // use file
} // fs.Dispose() is called automatically here
```

### 🔁 Without `using`:
```csharp
FileStream fs = null;
try
{
    fs = new FileStream("file.txt", FileMode.Open);
}
finally
{
    fs?.Dispose();
}
```

`using` makes the code shorter, cleaner, and less error-prone.

## 📏 Best Practices

### ✅ DOs:
- Always call `Dispose()` or use `using` for `IDisposable` objects
- Implement the Dispose pattern if your class manages unmanaged resources
- Use `GC.SuppressFinalize(this)` to avoid unnecessary GC overhead

### ❌ DON’Ts:
- Don’t access resources after disposing
- Don’t call `Dispose()` multiple times (guard with `_disposed` flag)
- Don’t rely on finalizers unless absolutely necessary

---

## 💻 Code Samples

### ✅ 1. Custom Class With Dispose Pattern
```csharp
public class CustomFileWriter : IDisposable
{
    private FileStream _stream;
    private bool _disposed = false;

    public CustomFileWriter(string path)
    {
        _stream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Create);
    }

    public void Write(string data)
    {
        byte[] buffer = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);
        _stream.Write(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!_disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
                _stream?.Dispose();
            _disposed = true;
        }
    }

    ~CustomFileWriter()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }
}
```

### ✅ 2. Real-World File Handling with `using`
```csharp
using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter("log.txt", append: true))
{
    writer.WriteLine($"[{DateTime.Now}] App started");
}
```

### ✅ 3. IAsyncDisposable Example
```csharp
public class AsyncResource : IAsyncDisposable
{
    private StreamWriter _writer;

    public AsyncResource(string path)
    {
        _writer = new StreamWriter(path);
    }

    public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()
    {
        if (_writer != null)
        {
            await _writer.DisposeAsync();
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp
await using var resource = new AsyncResource("log.txt");
await resource.DisposeAsync();
```

---

## 🧪 Unit Testing IDisposable

### ✅ Test Example
```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void Dispose_ShouldReleaseResources()
{
    var mockStream = new Mock<Stream>();
    var sut = new MyDisposableClass(mockStream.Object);

    sut.Dispose();

    mockStream.Verify(m => m.Dispose(), Times.Once);
}
```

---

## 🚫 Common Misconceptions
- **GC will clean everything** → GC does NOT handle unmanaged resources
- **Dispose is only for large objects** → even small unmanaged handles must be released
- **Dispose can be called anytime** → Dispose should be predictable and guarded
