# 📁 File Handling in C# – File Class

Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide on **File Handling in C#** using the `File` class from the `System.IO` namespace. This guide is designed specifically for students and first-time developers looking to build a solid foundation in working with files in C#.

---

## 📘 Introduction to File Handling in C#
File handling refers to the ability of a program to create, read, write, and manipulate files on a disk. It is a fundamental skill for building real-world applications, from simple data storage to complex logging systems.

---

## 🧠 Why File Handling is Important
Understanding file handling is crucial because it enables your programs to:
- Store and retrieve data persistently.
- Manage configuration and settings files.
- Process and analyze log data.
- Facilitate file-based communication between systems.

Without file handling, your applications would lose all data after each execution.

## 🛠️ Overview of the `System.IO` Namespace
The `System.IO` namespace provides the essential types needed for:
- Input/output operations on files and directories.
- Reading and writing text or binary data.
- File and directory manipulation.

**Key Classes in `System.IO`:**
- `File` – For basic file operations (static methods).
- `FileInfo` – For detailed file information (instance-based).
- `Directory` & `DirectoryInfo` – For folder operations.
- `StreamReader` / `StreamWriter` – For stream-based reading/writing.

---

## 📂 Introduction to the `File` Class
The `File` class provides static methods for performing common operations on files:
- Create
- Read
- Write
- Append
- Copy
- Move
- Delete
- Check existence

**Namespace to include:**
```csharp
using System.IO;
```

## 🧪 Basic Operations with Examples
Each example below shows how to perform common tasks using the `File` class.

### ✅ Creating a File
```csharp
File.Create("example.txt").Dispose();
```
> Creates an empty file named `example.txt`. We call `.Dispose()` to immediately release the file handle.

### ✍️ Writing to a File
```csharp
File.WriteAllText("example.txt", "Hello, World!");
```
> Overwrites the file with new content.

### 📖 Reading from a File
```csharp
string content = File.ReadAllText("example.txt");
Console.WriteLine(content);
```
> Reads and prints the file content.

### ➕ Appending Text to a File
```csharp
File.AppendAllText("example.txt", "\nThis is an appended line.");
```
> Appends a new line to the existing content.

### ❓ Checking if a File Exists
```csharp
if (File.Exists("example.txt"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("The file exists.");
}
```

### 🗑️ Deleting a File
```csharp
File.Delete("example.txt");
```
> Permanently removes the file.

### 🔁 Copying and Moving Files
```csharp
File.Copy("example.txt", "backup.txt", overwrite: true);
File.Move("backup.txt", "archive.txt");
```
> Copies `example.txt` to `backup.txt` (overwriting if needed), then moves `backup.txt` to `archive.txt`.

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling and Exceptions
File operations can throw exceptions that must be handled properly.

### Common Exceptions:
- `FileNotFoundException` – File doesn't exist.
- `IOException` – General I/O error.
- `UnauthorizedAccessException` – No permission to access the file.
- `DirectoryNotFoundException` – Folder doesn't exist.

### Handling Errors:
```csharp
try
{
    var content = File.ReadAllText("missing.txt");
}
catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error: File not found.");
}
catch (UnauthorizedAccessException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error: Access denied.");
}
```

## 🧼 Best Practices in File Handling
- ✅ Always check file existence before reading.
- ✅ Use `Path.Combine()` to build cross-platform file paths.
- ✅ Use `using` blocks for stream objects (e.g., `StreamWriter`).
- ✅ Prefer `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle exceptions.
- ✅ Avoid hardcoded paths in production code.

---

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
| Pitfall | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| File remains locked | Use `.Dispose()` or `using` statements |
| File not found | Use `File.Exists()` before reading |
| Hardcoded paths | Use `Path.Combine()` and environment variables |
| Missing error handling | Wrap operations in `try-catch` blocks |

## ✅ Final Summary
The `System.IO.File` class provides a powerful yet straightforward interface for managing file operations in C#. Understanding how to use its methods allows developers to build applications that store, retrieve, and manipulate data effectively. With best practices and proper error handling, file handling becomes a safe and robust part of your development toolbox.
