# FileEncryptionManager Class Documentation

## Overview

The `FileEncryptionManager` class provides secure file encryption and decryption capabilities using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). It implements the `IFileEncryption` interface and offers robust security features with proper resource management and comprehensive error handling.

## Key Features

- AES encryption implementation
- Secure key derivation using PBKDF2
- Unique initialization vector (IV) for each encryption
- Buffered file operations for efficiency
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Secure resource cleanup
- Progress tracking for operations

## Technical Specifications

### Encryption Details
- Algorithm: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- Key Derivation: PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)
- Hash Algorithm: SHA256
- Buffer Size: 80KB (81920 bytes)
- Iteration Count: 1000 (for key derivation)
- Salt Length: 13 bytes

## Constructor

```csharp
public FileEncryptionManager(ILogger logger)
```

### Parameters
- `logger`: ILogger implementation for operation logging and error tracking

### Initialization Process
- Validates logger instance
- Sets up encryption infrastructure
- Initializes internal state
- Configures buffer size for operations

## Public Methods

### EncryptFile
```csharp
public void EncryptFile(string sourceFile, string destinationFile, string password)
```
#### Purpose
Encrypts a file using AES encryption with a password-derived key.

#### Parameters
- `sourceFile`: Path to the file to encrypt
- `destinationFile`: Path where the encrypted file will be saved
- `password`: Password used for encryption key derivation

#### Process
1. Validates all input parameters
2. Generates encryption key from password
3. Creates unique IV for this encryption
4. Writes IV to the beginning of the destination file
5. Performs buffered encryption
6. Logs operation progress

### DecryptFile
```csharp
public void DecryptFile(string sourceFile, string destinationFile, string password)
```
#### Purpose
Decrypts a previously encrypted file.

#### Parameters
- `sourceFile`: Path to the encrypted file
- `destinationFile`: Path where the decrypted file will be saved
- `password`: Password used for original encryption

#### Process
1. Validates all input parameters
2. Reads IV from the encrypted file
3. Generates decryption key from password
4. Performs buffered decryption
5. Logs operation progress

## Security Features

### Password-Based Key Derivation
- Uses PBKDF2 with SHA256
- Implements salt for additional security
- Multiple iterations for increased security
- Generates keys of appropriate length for AES

### Initialization Vector (IV)
- Unique IV for each encryption operation
- Stored with encrypted file
- Prevents identical files from producing identical encrypted output
- Enhances security against pattern analysis

### Data Protection
- Secure memory handling
- Protected key storage
- Safe IV management
- Secure file operations

## Resource Management

### Dispose Pattern Implementation
```csharp
public void Dispose()
protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
```
- Implements IDisposable interface
- Ensures secure cleanup of cryptographic resources
- Handles both managed and unmanaged resources
- Implements finalizer for safety

## Error Handling

### Exception Types
- `ArgumentNullException`: For null input parameters
- `FileNotFoundException`: When source files don't exist
- `CryptographicException`: For encryption/decryption failures
- `IOException`: For file operation failures
- `ObjectDisposedException`: When accessing disposed instance

### Error Management
- Comprehensive exception handling
- Detailed error logging
- Secure error recovery
- Protection of sensitive data during errors

## Best Practices

1. Always use within a `using` block
2. Use strong passwords for encryption
3. Store passwords securely
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Verify file integrity after operations
6. Regular security audits
7. Keep encryption keys secure
8. Monitor operation logs

## Usage Example

```csharp
using (var encryptionManager = new FileEncryptionManager(logger))
{
    try
    {
        // Encrypt a file
        encryptionManager.EncryptFile(
            "sensitive.txt",
            "sensitive.encrypted",
            "StrongPassword123!"
        );
        Console.WriteLine("File encrypted successfully");

        // Decrypt the file
        encryptionManager.DecryptFile(
            "sensitive.encrypted",
            "sensitive_decrypted.txt",
            "StrongPassword123!"
        );
        Console.WriteLine("File decrypted successfully");
    }
    catch (CryptographicException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Encryption error: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```
