# **Tasks for Mastering Abstract Classes in C#**

## Task 1: Understanding Abstract Classes
- **Objective:** Understand the concept of abstract classes and their usage in C#.
- **Description:** Read about abstract classes, abstract methods, and when to use them.
- **Resources:** [Abstract Classes in C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/abstract-and-sealed-classes-and-class-members)

## Task 2: Document Processing System
- **Objective:** Implement an abstract class for document handling.
- **Instructions:**
  - Create an abstract class `Document` with abstract properties `Title`, `Author`, and `CreatedDate`.
  - Include abstract methods `Convert(string format)`, `Validate()`, and `GetDocumentInfo()`.
  - Add a non-abstract method `DisplayMetadata()` that uses `GetDocumentInfo()`.
  - Create concrete classes `PDFDocument`, `WordDocument`, and `SpreadsheetDocument`.
  - Inside each concrete class:
    - Implement all abstract properties and methods
    - Add format-specific validation rules
    - Add format-specific conversion logic
    - Add format-specific metadata handling
  - Test the implementation with a variety of valid and invalid document scenarios.
  - Create a document processor class that can handle any document type polymorphically.

## Task 3: Payment Processing System
- **Objective:** Create a payment processing system using abstract classes.
- **Instructions:**
  - Create an abstract class `PaymentMethod` with properties `PaymentType`, `ProcessingFee`, and `TransactionId`.
  - Implement abstract methods `ProcessPayment(decimal amount)`, `ValidatePaymentDetails()`, and `GenerateReceipt()`.
  - Add a protected method `CalculateTotal(decimal amount)` that includes processing fees.
  - Create derived classes:
    - `CreditCardPayment`:
      - Implement card number masking
      - Add CVV validation
      - Handle card expiration checks
      - Process refunds
    - `PayPalPayment`:
      - Implement email verification
      - Handle token expiration
      - Process API responses
      - Handle payment disputes
    - `CryptoCurrencyPayment`:
      - Implement wallet validation
      - Calculate exchange rates
      - Handle blockchain confirmations
      - Process crypto-specific fees
  - Implement a transaction history system.
  - Add proper exception handling for failed payments.

## Task 4: Notification Service
- **Objective:** Build a notification system using abstract classes.
- **Instructions:**
  - Design an abstract class `NotificationSender` with priority, delivery status, and retry count.
  - Include abstract methods `Send()`, `ValidateContent()`, and `GetDeliveryStatus()`.
  - Add a protected method `LogNotification()` for tracking.
  - Create concrete implementations:
    - `EmailNotification`:
      - Handle email attachments
      - Implement HTML formatting
      - Validate email addresses
      - Handle bounce notifications
    - `SMSNotification`:
      - Validate character limits
      - Handle delivery confirmations
      - Process carrier responses
      - Implement retry logic
    - `PushNotification`:
      - Manage device tokens
      - Validate payload size
      - Handle platform-specific requirements
      - Process delivery receipts
  - Implement a notification queue system.
  - Add support for notification templates.

## Task 5: Real-World Application - Report Generation System
- **Objective:** Apply abstract classes in a comprehensive report generation system.
- **Instructions:**
  - Create an abstract class `Report` with properties for report type, timeframe, and format preferences.
  - Include abstract methods `GatherData()`, `ProcessData()`, `GenerateReport()`, and `ExportReport(string format)`.
  - Add protected methods for data validation and formatting.
  - Implement concrete classes:
    - `FinancialReport`:
      - Calculate financial metrics
      - Format currencies
      - Generate balance sheets
      - Create profit/loss statements
    - `AnalyticsReport`:
      - Create data visualizations
      - Analyze trends
      - Generate statistical summaries
      - Export interactive charts
    - `InventoryReport`:
      - Track stock levels
      - Generate reorder alerts
      - Calculate inventory turnover
      - Predict future stock needs
  - Create a reporting scheduler system.
  - Implement caching for frequently accessed reports.
  - Add support for different output formats (PDF, Excel, CSV).

## Requirements for All Tasks
1. Proper implementation of abstract and non-abstract members
2. Comprehensive exception handling and logging
3. Input validation and data sanitization
4. Follow C# coding conventions and SOLID principles
5. Include XML documentation comments
6. Implement unit tests for all concrete implementations
7. Add performance monitoring where appropriate

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding abstract classes and their role in system design
- Implementing abstract methods and properties effectively
- Working with protected members and inheritance
- Designing clean and maintainable class hierarchies
- Applying proper error handling and logging
- Writing testable code
- Understanding when to use abstract classes vs interfaces

## Additional Challenges
- Implement dependency injection
- Add async/await support where appropriate
- Create custom exceptions for specific error scenarios
- Implement the Observer pattern for status updates
- Add support for serialization/deserialization

Good luck with your practice tasks!
