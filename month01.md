    - **Switches and Routers**: Switches manage connections within the network, while routers connect different networks.

2. **Define the roles of a client and a server in networking.**  
   **Answer**:
    - **Client**: Requests data or services from a server (e.g., web browsers requesting websites).
    - **Server**: Provides resources, data, or services to clients (e.g., web servers hosting websites).

3. **What is the difference between frontend and backend development?**  
   **Answer**:
    - **Frontend**: Focuses on the user interface and user experience (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
    - **Backend**: Handles server-side logic, data processing, and integration with databases (e.g., C#, Java).

4. **Can you explain how a frontend communicates with a backend in a web application?**  
   **Answer**:  
   The frontend sends HTTP/HTTPS requests to the backend using APIs. The backend processes the request, performs operations (like database queries), and sends a response (in formats like JSON or XML).

5. **What is the role of a database in a client-server architecture?**  
   **Answer**:  
   A database stores, retrieves, and manages data. The server accesses it to process client requests and perform operations like reading, updating, or deleting data.

**Topics: Networking Concepts**

1. **Explain simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex communication with examples.**  
   **Answer**:
    - **Simplex**: Data flows in one direction only (e.g., radio broadcasting).
    - **Half-Duplex**: Data flows in both directions but not simultaneously (e.g., walkie-talkies).
    - **Full-Duplex**: Data flows in both directions at the same time (e.g., phone calls).

2. **What is the difference between peer-to-peer and client-server networks?**  
   **Answer**:
    - **Peer-to-Peer**: Devices share resources directly with each other (e.g., file sharing).
    - **Client-Server**: Resources are managed centrally by a server (e.g., email systems).

3. **Define LAN, MAN, and WAN. Give examples of where they are used.**  
   **Answer**:
    - **LAN**: Covers a small area like an office or home (e.g., Wi-Fi network).
    - **MAN**: Covers a city or metropolitan area (e.g., city-wide internet service).
    - **WAN**: Covers a large geographic area (e.g., the internet).

4. **What are the advantages of a mesh topology compared to a star topology?**  
   **Answer**:
    - Mesh topology offers high fault tolerance because every node is interconnected.
    - Star topology relies on a central hub, so hub failure disrupts the network.

#### **Week 5 - Day 1 (04.10.2024)**
**Topics: Stack vs Heap Memory**

1. **What is the difference between stack memory and heap memory in C#?**  
   **Answer**:
    - **Stack Memory**:
        - Stores value types and method call data.
        - Automatically managed, grows and shrinks with method calls.
        - Fast and follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
    - **Heap Memory**:
        - Stores reference types and objects created dynamically.
        - Managed by the garbage collector, slower compared to the stack.

2. **Where are value types stored, and where are reference types stored in memory?**  
   **Answer**:
    - **Value Types**: Stored in the stack.
    - **Reference Types**: The reference (or pointer) is stored in the stack, but the object data itself is stored in the heap.

3. **What happens to stack and heap memory when a program is executed?**  
   **Answer**:
    - The stack is used for method execution and local variables. It grows when methods are called and shrinks when they return.
    - The heap is used for dynamically allocated objects. Garbage collection reclaims unused objects to free up heap memory.

4. **Explain how garbage collection works in .NET.**  
   **Answer**:
    - Garbage collection is an automatic memory management system in .NET.
    - It identifies and removes objects from the heap that are no longer in use or referenced, freeing memory for new objects.
    - This process ensures efficient memory use and prevents memory leaks.

5. **Why is stack memory faster than heap memory?**  
   **Answer**:  
   Stack memory is faster because it follows the LIFO principle, requiring no complex memory allocation or deallocation. The heap involves dynamic memory allocation, which is slower and requires more processing.

#### **Week 5 - Day 2 (06.10.2024)**
**Topics: Output, Comments, Variables (Value Types)**

1. **How do you print output to the console in C#?**  
   **Answer**:  
   Use the `Console.WriteLine()` method.  
   Example:
   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
   ```

2. **What are comments in C#, and why are they used?**  
   **Answer**:  
   Comments are non-executable lines of code that document or explain logic. They improve code readability and help developers understand the purpose of the code.
    - Single-line comments: `// This is a single-line comment`
    - Multi-line comments:
      ```csharp
      /* This is a  
         multi-line comment */
      ```

3. **Explain the difference between single-line and multi-line comments in C#.**  
   **Answer**:
    - **Single-line Comments**: Use `//` and are ideal for short explanations.
    - **Multi-line Comments**: Use `/* */` and are suitable for longer explanations or temporarily disabling blocks of code.

4. **What are value types in C#? Provide examples.**  
   **Answer**:  
   Value types store data directly in memory and include:
    - **Numeric Types**: `int`, `float`, `double`
    - **Character Type**: `char`
    - **Boolean Type**: `bool`  
      Example:
   ```csharp
   int age = 25;
   bool isActive = true;
   ```

5. **How do you declare and initialize a variable in C#?**  
   **Answer**:  
   Variables are declared with a data type, followed by a name, and optionally assigned a value.  
   Example:
   ```csharp
   int number = 10; // Declaration and initialization
   ```
